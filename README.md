This is an exploration of the [Google vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) (Circa 2016), It's hosted on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) and uses [webcam.js](https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs) to allow users to take a picture with their webcam and submit it for analysis.

It collects a gallery of the results, storing images to google cloud storage and results to the datastore

This was something I built a long time and haven't updated, it's got a garish colour scheme and layout and I'm just leaving it all here as a historical artifact.
